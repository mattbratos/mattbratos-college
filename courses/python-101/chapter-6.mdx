# Chapter 6: Lists and Collections 📝

So far you've been working with one piece of data at a time. But what if you need to store multiple items? Meet **lists** - Python's way of keeping multiple values organized in one place! 📦

## What are Lists? 🤔

A list is like a shopping list or a playlist - it holds multiple items in order. You can add, remove, and change items whenever you want!

```python
# Creating lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = ["Alice", 25, True, 3.14]
empty_list = []

print(fruits)      # ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
print(numbers)     # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(mixed_list)  # ['Alice', 25, True, 3.14]
```

## Accessing List Items 🔍

Lists use **indexes** (positions) starting from 0:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]

print(fruits[0])    # apple (first item)
print(fruits[1])    # banana (second item)
print(fruits[-1])   # grape (last item)
print(fruits[-2])   # orange (second to last)

# Get multiple items (slicing)
print(fruits[1:3])  # ['banana', 'orange'] (items 1 and 2)
print(fruits[:2])   # ['apple', 'banana'] (first 2 items)
print(fruits[2:])   # ['orange', 'grape'] (from item 2 to end)
```

## Adding Items to Lists ➕

```python
# Start with an empty shopping list
shopping_list = []

# Add items one by one
shopping_list.append("milk")
shopping_list.append("eggs")
shopping_list.append("bread")

print(shopping_list)  # ['milk', 'eggs', 'bread']

# Add multiple items
shopping_list.extend(["apples", "cheese"])
print(shopping_list)  # ['milk', 'eggs', 'bread', 'apples', 'cheese']

# Insert at specific position
shopping_list.insert(1, "butter")  # Insert at position 1
print(shopping_list)  # ['milk', 'butter', 'eggs', 'bread', 'apples', 'cheese']
```

## Removing Items from Lists ➖

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "banana", "grape"]

# Remove by value (first occurrence)
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'grape']

# Remove by index
removed_item = fruits.pop(1)  # Removes and returns item at index 1
print(f"Removed: {removed_item}")  # Removed: orange
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'grape']

# Remove last item
last_item = fruits.pop()
print(f"Last item: {last_item}")  # Last item: grape
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana']

# Clear entire list
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # []
```

## Modifying Lists 🔧

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

# Change an item
colors[1] = "yellow"
print(colors)  # ['red', 'yellow', 'blue']

# Change multiple items
colors[1:3] = ["purple", "pink"]
print(colors)  # ['red', 'purple', 'pink']

# Sort the list
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]

# Reverse the list
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)  # [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]
```

## Useful List Methods and Functions 🛠️

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "banana"]

# Check if item exists
print("banana" in fruits)      # True
print("grape" in fruits)       # False

# Count occurrences
print(fruits.count("banana"))  # 2

# Find index of item
print(fruits.index("orange"))  # 2

# Get list length
print(len(fruits))             # 4

# Get sum (for numbers)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(numbers))            # 15
print(max(numbers))            # 5
print(min(numbers))            # 1
```

## Looping Through Lists 🔄

This is where lists really shine - you can process each item easily!

```python
# Method 1: Simple loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I love {fruit}!")

# Method 2: Loop with index
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(f"Item {i}: {fruits[i]}")

# Method 3: Enumerate (best of both worlds)
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

# Method 4: While loop
i = 0
while i < len(fruits):
    print(fruits[i])
    i += 1
```

## Interactive Examples 🧪

### Example 1: Dynamic To-Do List
```python
todo_list = []

while True:
    print("\n=== TO-DO LIST ===")
    print("Current tasks:")
    
    if len(todo_list) == 0:
        print("No tasks yet!")
    else:
        for i, task in enumerate(todo_list, 1):
            print(f"{i}. {task}")
    
    print("\nOptions:")
    print("1. Add task")
    print("2. Complete task")
    print("3. Quit")
    
    choice = input("Choose an option: ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        task = input("Enter new task: ")
        todo_list.append(task)
        print(f"Added: {task}")
    
    elif choice == "2":
        if len(todo_list) > 0:
            try:
                task_num = int(input("Which task number to complete? "))
                completed_task = todo_list.pop(task_num - 1)
                print(f"Completed: {completed_task}")
            except (ValueError, IndexError):
                print("Invalid task number!")
        else:
            print("No tasks to complete!")
    
    elif choice == "3":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    
    else:
        print("Invalid choice!")
```

### Example 2: Grade Calculator
```python
# Collect student grades
grades = []
print("Enter student grades (type 'done' when finished):")

while True:
    grade_input = input("Enter grade: ")
    if grade_input.lower() == "done":
        break
    try:
        grade = float(grade_input)
        if 0 <= grade <= 100:
            grades.append(grade)
        else:
            print("Grade must be between 0 and 100!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")

# Calculate statistics
if len(grades) > 0:
    average = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    highest = max(grades)
    lowest = min(grades)
    
    print(f"\n=== GRADE REPORT ===")
    print(f"Total grades: {len(grades)}")
    print(f"Average: {average:.2f}")
    print(f"Highest: {highest}")
    print(f"Lowest: {lowest}")
    
    # Count letter grades
    a_count = len([g for g in grades if g >= 90])
    b_count = len([g for g in grades if 80 <= g < 90])
    c_count = len([g for g in grades if 70 <= g < 80])
    d_count = len([g for g in grades if 60 <= g < 70])
    f_count = len([g for g in grades if g < 60])
    
    print(f"\nGrade Distribution:")
    print(f"A's: {a_count}")
    print(f"B's: {b_count}")
    print(f"C's: {c_count}")
    print(f"D's: {d_count}")
    print(f"F's: {f_count}")
else:
    print("No grades entered!")
```

### Example 3: Word Game
```python
# Guess the word game
import random

word_list = ["python", "programming", "computer", "keyboard", "monitor", "software"]
secret_word = random.choice(word_list)
guessed_letters = []
wrong_guesses = []
max_wrong = 6

print("=== WORD GUESSING GAME ===")
print(f"Guess the {len(secret_word)}-letter word!")

while len(wrong_guesses) < max_wrong:
    # Show current progress
    display_word = ""
    for letter in secret_word:
        if letter in guessed_letters:
            display_word += letter + " "
        else:
            display_word += "_ "
    
    print(f"\nWord: {display_word}")
    print(f"Wrong guesses: {', '.join(wrong_guesses)}")
    print(f"Guesses remaining: {max_wrong - len(wrong_guesses)}")
    
    # Check if won
    if "_" not in display_word:
        print(f"🎉 You won! The word was '{secret_word}'!")
        break
    
    # Get guess
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
    
    if len(guess) != 1 or not guess.isalpha():
        print("Please enter a single letter!")
        continue
    
    if guess in guessed_letters or guess in wrong_guesses:
        print("You already guessed that letter!")
        continue
    
    # Check guess
    if guess in secret_word:
        guessed_letters.append(guess)
        print("Good guess!")
    else:
        wrong_guesses.append(guess)
        print("Wrong letter!")
else:
    print(f"💀 Game over! The word was '{secret_word}'")
```

## List Comprehensions (Bonus!) ⚡

A super-cool Python feature to create lists in one line:

```python
# Traditional way
squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

# List comprehension way (much cooler!)
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# More examples
even_numbers = [i for i in range(20) if i % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
upper_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
print(upper_fruits)  # ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'ORANGE']
```

## Working with Multiple Lists 🤝

```python
# Parallel lists (related data)
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
cities = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"]

# Print together using zip
for name, age, city in zip(names, ages, cities):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}")

# Combine lists
all_info = list(zip(names, ages, cities))
print(all_info)  # [('Alice', 25, 'New York'), ('Bob', 30, 'Los Angeles'), ('Charlie', 35, 'Chicago')]
```

## Common List Mistakes ⚠️

1. **Index out of range:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
# print(fruits[5])  # Error! Index 5 doesn't exist

# Better: Check length first
if len(fruits) > 5:
    print(fruits[5])
else:
    print("Index 5 doesn't exist")
```

2. **Modifying list while looping:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Wrong: Don't modify list while iterating
# for num in numbers:
#     if num % 2 == 0:
#         numbers.remove(num)  # This can skip items!

# Right: Create new list or iterate backwards
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

## Chapter Summary 📝

🎉 **Outstanding work!** You've mastered:
- Creating and accessing lists with indexes
- Adding, removing, and modifying list items
- Essential list methods (append, remove, pop, sort, etc.)
- Looping through lists efficiently
- Building interactive applications with lists
- List comprehensions for advanced list creation
- Working with multiple related lists

**Key takeaways:**
- Lists store multiple items in order, starting from index 0
- Use `append()` to add items, `remove()` or `pop()` to delete
- `for item in list:` is the most common way to loop through lists
- Lists are mutable - you can change them after creation
- Lists + loops = powerful data processing capabilities
- Always check list length before accessing indexes
