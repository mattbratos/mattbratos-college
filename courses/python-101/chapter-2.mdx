# Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types 📊

Now that you can print things, let's learn how to store and work with information! Variables are like labeled boxes where you can keep data for later use. 📦

## What are Variables? 🤔

Think of variables as **named storage containers**. Instead of writing the same information over and over, you can store it once and use it many times!

```python
# Without variables (repetitive!)
print("Alice is 25 years old")
print("Alice likes pizza")
print("Alice lives in New York")

# With variables (much better!)
name = "Alice"
age = 25
favorite_food = "pizza"
city = "New York"

print(name, "is", age, "years old")
print(name, "likes", favorite_food)
print(name, "lives in", city)
```

## Creating Variables ✨

Creating a variable in Python is super easy:

```python
# Create variables by assigning values
my_name = "Your Name"
my_age = 20
is_student = True

# Use them in print statements
print("Hello, my name is", my_name)
print("I am", my_age, "years old")
print("Am I a student?", is_student)
```

**Variable naming rules:**
- Use descriptive names: `user_age` not `a`
- Start with letter or underscore: `name` or `_score`
- Use lowercase with underscores: `favorite_color`
- No spaces: `first_name` not `first name`

## Python Data Types 🧩

Python has several types of data. Let's explore the main ones:

### 1. Strings (Text) 📝
Strings are text wrapped in quotes:

```python
first_name = "Alex"
last_name = 'Johnson'  # Single or double quotes work!
message = "Welcome to Python programming!"

print(first_name + " " + last_name)  # Combining strings
print("Message:", message)
```

### 2. Integers (Whole Numbers) 🔢
Integers are whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero):

```python
score = 100
temperature = -5
items_count = 0

print("Your score:", score)
print("Temperature:", temperature, "degrees")
print("Items in cart:", items_count)
```

### 3. Floats (Decimal Numbers) 🔣
Floats have decimal points:

```python
price = 19.99
height = 5.8
pi = 3.14159

print("Price: $", price)
print("Height:", height, "feet")
print("Pi is approximately", pi)
```

### 4. Booleans (True/False) ✅❌
Booleans represent True or False:

```python
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False
likes_python = True

print("Is it sunny?", is_sunny)
print("Is it raining?", is_raining)
print("Do you like Python?", likes_python)
```

## Interactive Examples 🧪

Let's try some hands-on examples:

### Example 1: Personal Profile
```python
# Create your profile
name = "Sam"
age = 22
height = 5.9
is_student = True
favorite_color = "blue"

# Display your profile
print("=== MY PROFILE ===")
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "feet")
print("Student:", is_student)
print("Favorite color:", favorite_color)
```

### Example 2: Basic Math with Variables
```python
# Store numbers
first_number = 15
second_number = 7

# Do calculations
sum_result = first_number + second_number
difference = first_number - second_number
product = first_number * second_number

# Show results
print(first_number, "+", second_number, "=", sum_result)
print(first_number, "-", second_number, "=", difference)
print(first_number, "×", second_number, "=", product)
```

## Getting Input from Users 🎤

Make your programs interactive with `input()`:

```python
# Ask for user's name
user_name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you,", user_name + "!")

# Ask for their age
user_age = input("How old are you? ")
print("Wow,", user_age, "is a great age!")
```

**Important:** `input()` always gives you a string, even if the user types numbers!

### Converting Input to Numbers 🔄

```python
# Get a number from user
age_text = input("Enter your age: ")
age_number = int(age_text)  # Convert to integer

# Now you can do math with it!
years_until_30 = 30 - age_number
print("You'll be 30 in", years_until_30, "years!")

# Or do it in one line:
height = float(input("Enter your height in feet: "))
print("Your height is", height, "feet")
```

## Practical Exercise 💻

Create a program called `my_info.py` that:
1. Asks for your name, age, and favorite hobby
2. Stores them in variables
3. Displays a nice formatted message using those variables

Example run:
```
What's your name? Sarah
How old are you? 23
What's your favorite hobby? reading

Hello Sarah! You are 23 years old and you love reading. That's awesome!
```

## Challenge: Simple Calculator 🏆

**Your Mission:** Build a calculator that asks for two numbers and shows all basic math operations!

**Requirements:**
- Ask user for two numbers
- Convert them to proper number types
- Calculate: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Display all results in a nice format

**Example output:**
```
=== SIMPLE CALCULATOR ===
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 4

Results:
12 + 4 = 16
12 - 4 = 8
12 × 4 = 48
12 ÷ 4 = 3.0
```

**Bonus points:** Add some decorative borders and make it look professional! 🎨

## Understanding Type Checking 🔍

You can check what type a variable is:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.7
is_student = True

print(type(name))      # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))       # <class 'int'>
print(type(height))    # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student)) # <class 'bool'>
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ⚠️

1. **Forgetting quotes for strings:**
```python
# Wrong:
name = Alice  # Error! Python looks for a variable called Alice

# Right:
name = "Alice"
```

2. **Not converting input:**
```python
# Wrong:
age = input("Age: ")
next_year = age + 1  # Error! Can't add number to string

# Right:
age = int(input("Age: "))
next_year = age + 1
```

## Chapter Summary 📝

🎉 **Great job!** You now know how to:
- Create and use variables to store data
- Work with different data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Get input from users with `input()`
- Convert between different data types
- Build interactive programs that respond to user input

**Key takeaways:**
- Variables store data for reuse: `name = "Alice"`
- Strings need quotes, numbers don't
- `input()` always returns strings
- Use `int()` and `float()` to convert strings to numbers
- Variables make your code more flexible and maintainable
