# Chapter 5: Loops and Repetition 🔄

Imagine having to write `print("Hello!")` 100 times... That would be insane! 😵 Loops let you repeat code efficiently. They're like having a robot assistant that does repetitive tasks for you! 🤖

## Why Do We Need Loops? 🤷‍♀️

Without loops, this would be terrible:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS! 😱
print("Welcome!")
print("Welcome!")
print("Welcome!")
print("Welcome!")
print("Welcome!")
# ... 95 more times!
```

With loops, it's elegant:
```python
# MUCH BETTER! ✨
for i in range(100):
    print("Welcome!")
```

## For Loops: Repeat a Specific Number of Times 🔢

### Basic For Loop Structure

```python
# Basic syntax
for i in range(5):
    print(f"This is iteration {i}")
    print("Hello!")

print("Loop finished!")
```

**Output:**
```
This is iteration 0
Hello!
This is iteration 1
Hello!
This is iteration 2
Hello!
This is iteration 3
Hello!
This is iteration 4
Hello!
Loop finished!
```

### Understanding `range()` 📏

```python
# range(5) gives us: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
for num in range(5):
    print(num)

# range(start, stop) 
for num in range(1, 6):  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    print(num)

# range(start, stop, step)
for num in range(0, 10, 2):  # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
    print(num)

# Countdown!
for num in range(10, 0, -1):  # 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    print(num)
print("Blast off! 🚀")
```

### Practical For Loop Examples 🧪

```python
# Example 1: Multiplication table
number = int(input("Enter a number for multiplication table: "))

print(f"\n=== Multiplication Table for {number} ===")
for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(f"{number} × {i} = {result}")

# Example 2: Password generator
import random
import string

print("Generating a random password...")
password = ""
for i in range(8):  # 8 character password
    random_char = random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits)
    password += random_char

print(f"Your password: {password}")

# Example 3: Sum calculator
total = 0
print("Enter 5 numbers to add:")
for i in range(5):
    number = float(input(f"Number {i+1}: "))
    total += number

print(f"The sum is: {total}")
```

## While Loops: Repeat Until a Condition is Met 🔄

While loops continue until a condition becomes False:

```python
# Basic while loop
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count is: {count}")
    count += 1  # Same as: count = count + 1

print("Done!")
```

### While Loop vs For Loop 🤔

**Use For loops when:** You know how many times to repeat
**Use While loops when:** You repeat until something happens

```python
# For loop: We know we want exactly 10 iterations
for i in range(10):
    print("Hello!")

# While loop: We don't know when user will say "quit"
user_input = ""
while user_input != "quit":
    user_input = input("Type 'quit' to exit: ")
    if user_input != "quit":
        print(f"You said: {user_input}")
```

### Interactive While Loop Examples 🎮

```python
# Example 1: Simple menu system
choice = ""
while choice != "quit":
    print("\n=== MAIN MENU ===")
    print("1. Say hello")
    print("2. Tell a joke")
    print("3. Calculate square")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit")
    
    choice = input("Choose an option: ").lower()
    
    if choice == "1":
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print(f"Hello, {name}! 👋")
    elif choice == "2":
        print("Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! 😄")
    elif choice == "3":
        num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
        print(f"{num} squared is {num**2}")
    elif choice != "quit":
        print("Invalid choice! Try again.")

print("Goodbye! 👋")

# Example 2: Number guessing game setup
import random

secret_number = random.randint(1, 10)
guess = 0
attempts = 0

print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10!")

while guess != secret_number:
    guess = int(input("What's your guess? "))
    attempts += 1
    
    if guess < secret_number:
        print("Too low! Try higher! ⬆️")
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("Too high! Try lower! ⬇️")
    else:
        print(f"🎉 Correct! You got it in {attempts} attempts!")
```

## Loop Control: `break` and `continue` 🛑

### `break`: Exit the loop immediately
```python
# Stop loop when we find what we're looking for
for num in range(1, 100):
    if num * num == 64:  # Looking for number that squares to 64
        print(f"Found it! {num} squared is 64")
        break
    print(f"Checking {num}...")

# Infinite loop with break condition
count = 0
while True:  # This would run forever without break!
    count += 1
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    if count >= 5:
        print("Stopping the loop!")
        break
```

### `continue`: Skip to next iteration
```python
# Print only even numbers
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 1:  # If odd number
        continue  # Skip the rest of this iteration
    print(f"{num} is even!")

# Skip empty input
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter something (or 'quit'): ").strip()
    if user_input == "quit":
        break
    if user_input == "":  # Empty input
        print("You didn't enter anything!")
        continue  # Go back to start of loop
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```

## Nested Loops: Loops Inside Loops 🪆

```python
# Example 1: Multiplication table for multiple numbers
for num in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop: numbers 1, 2, 3
    print(f"\n=== Table for {num} ===")
    for multiplier in range(1, 6):  # Inner loop: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
        result = num * multiplier
        print(f"{num} × {multiplier} = {result}")

# Example 2: Pattern maker
rows = 5
for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print("★", end=" ")  # end=" " keeps everything on same line
    print()  # New line after each row
```

**Output:**
```
★ 
★ ★ 
★ ★ ★ 
★ ★ ★ ★ 
★ ★ ★ ★ ★ 
```

## Practical Exercises 💻

**Example interaction:**
```
🎲 === ULTIMATE GUESSING GAME === 🎲

Choose difficulty:
1. Easy (1-10, unlimited guesses)
2. Medium (1-50, 7 guesses) 
3. Hard (1-100, 5 guesses)

Choice: 2

🎯 Medium Mode: Guess the number between 1-50!
You have 7 guesses. Good luck! 🍀

Guess #1: 25
📈 Too high! Try lower!
Remaining guesses: 6

Guess #2: 15
📉 Too low! Try higher!
Remaining guesses: 5

Guess #3: 20
🔥 Very close! But still too high!
Remaining guesses: 4

Guess #4: 18
🎉 CORRECT! You won in 4 attempts!
⭐ Excellent performance! ⭐

Play again? (yes/no): 
```

## Advanced Loop Techniques 🎯

### Loop with Else (Mind-blowing feature!)
```python
# The else runs if the loop completes without breaking
for num in range(2, 10):
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(f"{num} is not prime")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{num} is prime!")
```

### Enumerate: Get Index and Value
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Instead of this:
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(f"{i}: {fruits[i]}")

# Use this:
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
```

## Common Loop Mistakes ⚠️

1. **Infinite loops (forgetting to update condition):**
```python
# Wrong:
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    # Forgot: count += 1

# Right:
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

2. **Off-by-one errors:**
```python
# Wrong: This prints 0-9 (10 numbers)
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# If you want 1-10:
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

## Chapter Summary 📝

🎉 **Amazing progress!** You've mastered:
- For loops for repeating code a specific number of times
- While loops for repeating until a condition is met
- `range()` function for generating number sequences
- Loop control with `break` and `continue`
- Nested loops for complex patterns
- Real-world applications like games and calculators

**Key takeaways:**
- Use for loops when you know the number of iterations
- Use while loops when you repeat based on conditions
- Always make sure while loops have a way to stop (avoid infinite loops!)
- `break` exits the loop, `continue` skips to next iteration
- Loops + conditionals = powerful programs that can solve complex problems
