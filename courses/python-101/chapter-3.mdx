# Chapter 3: Working with Text and Numbers 🔢

Time to level up! Let's learn how to manipulate text like a pro and perform cool calculations. You'll be amazed at what Python can do with strings and numbers! ✨

## String Superpowers 🦸‍♀️

Strings aren't just boring text - they have built-in superpowers called **methods**! Think of methods as special abilities that strings can perform.

### String Methods in Action 🎬

```python
message = "Hello Python World"

# Try these string superpowers:
print(message.upper())        # HELLO PYTHON WORLD
print(message.lower())        # hello python world
print(message.title())        # Hello Python World
print(message.replace("World", "Universe"))  # Hello Python Universe
print(message.count("o"))     # 2 (counts how many 'o's)
```

### More Useful String Methods 🛠️

```python
name = "  alice johnson  "

# Clean up messy text:
print(name.strip())           # "alice johnson" (removes spaces)
print(name.strip().title())   # "Alice Johnson" (clean + capitalize)

# Check what's in your string:
email = "user@example.com"
print(email.startswith("user"))  # True
print(email.endswith(".com"))     # True
print("@" in email)               # True (checks if @ is in the string)
```

### String Formatting Magic ✨

Instead of messy concatenation, use f-strings (formatted strings):

```python
name = "Sarah"
age = 25
city = "Boston"

# Old way (works but messy):
message = "Hi, I'm " + name + " and I'm " + str(age) + " years old from " + city

# New way (clean and readable):
message = f"Hi, I'm {name} and I'm {age} years old from {city}"
print(message)

# You can even do calculations inside f-strings!
price = 19.99
print(f"Total with tax: ${price * 1.08:.2f}")  # Rounds to 2 decimal places
```

### Interactive String Examples 🧪

```python
# Get user's full name and format it nicely
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ").strip().title()
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ").strip().title()

full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
initials = f"{first_name[0]}.{last_name[0]}."

print(f"Full name: {full_name}")
print(f"Initials: {initials}")
print(f"Username suggestion: {first_name.lower()}{len(last_name)}")
```

## Math Operations & Number Magic 🧮

Python is a powerful calculator! Let's explore what you can do with numbers.

### Basic Math Operations 🔢

```python
a = 15
b = 4

print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {a + b}")        # 19
print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {a - b}")     # 11
print(f"Multiplication: {a} × {b} = {a * b}")  # 60
print(f"Division: {a} ÷ {b} = {a / b}")        # 3.75
print(f"Floor Division: {a} // {b} = {a // b}") # 3 (no decimals)
print(f"Modulus (remainder): {a} % {b} = {a % b}") # 3
print(f"Exponent: {a} ** {b} = {a ** b}")      # 50625
```

### Useful Math Functions 📐

```python
import math  # Import the math module for extra functions

number = -7.8

print(f"Absolute value: {abs(number)}")        # 7.8
print(f"Rounded: {round(3.7)}")               # 4
print(f"Round to 2 places: {round(3.14159, 2)}") # 3.14
print(f"Square root: {math.sqrt(16)}")        # 4.0
print(f"Ceiling: {math.ceil(3.2)}")           # 4
print(f"Floor: {math.floor(3.8)}")            # 3
```

### Number Formatting 💅

```python
big_number = 1234567.89
percentage = 0.85

# Format numbers nicely:
print(f"Currency: ${big_number:,.2f}")         # $1,234,567.89
print(f"Percentage: {percentage:.1%}")         # 85.0%
print(f"Scientific: {big_number:.2e}")         # 1.23e+06
```

## Combining Text and Numbers 🤝

```python
# Calculate and display user stats
name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()
birth_year = int(input("What year were you born? "))

current_year = 2024
age = current_year - birth_year
next_birthday = age + 1

# Create a nice report:
report = f"""
=== {name}'s Age Report ===
Born: {birth_year}
Current Age: {age} years old
Next Birthday: You'll turn {next_birthday}!
Days lived (approx): {age * 365:,} days
Months lived (approx): {age * 12} months
"""

print(report)
```

## Practical Exercises 💻

### Exercise 1: Text Processor
Create a program that takes a sentence and shows:
- Original sentence
- Uppercase version
- Lowercase version
- Number of words
- Number of characters (including spaces)
- Number of characters (excluding spaces)

### Exercise 2: Name Generator
Ask for first and last name, then create:
- Email suggestions (firstname.lastname@email.com)
- Username suggestions (first letter + last name + random number)
- Display name for social media

## Challenge: Mad Libs Game Creator 🏆

**Your Mission:** Create an interactive Mad Libs game that creates a funny story!

**Requirements:**
- Ask user for various inputs (nouns, verbs, adjectives, numbers)
- Store them in variables with descriptive names
- Create a story template using f-strings
- Display the completed funny story
- Make it colorful with decorative borders

**Example interaction:**
```
=== MAD LIBS STORY CREATOR ===
Enter a noun: elephant
Enter a verb: dancing
Enter an adjective: purple
Enter a number: 42
Enter a place: kitchen

=== YOUR STORY ===
Once upon a time, there was a purple elephant who loved dancing
in the kitchen. Every day, it would practice for 42 hours until
it became the most famous dancing elephant in the world!
```

**Bonus features:**
- Use string methods to format inputs (capitalize, etc.)
- Add multiple story templates and let user choose
- Calculate and display story statistics (word count, character count)

## Advanced String Techniques 🎯

```python
# String slicing (getting parts of strings)
phrase = "Python Programming"
print(phrase[0])        # P (first character)
print(phrase[-1])       # g (last character)
print(phrase[0:6])      # Python (characters 0 to 5)
print(phrase[7:])       # Programming (from position 7 to end)

# Split strings into lists
sentence = "I love Python programming"
words = sentence.split()  # ['I', 'love', 'Python', 'programming']
print(f"Word count: {len(words)}")

# Join lists back into strings
new_sentence = " ".join(words)  # Put words back together
print(new_sentence)
```

## Working with User Input Like a Pro 🎭

```python
def get_clean_input(prompt):
    """Get input from user and clean it up"""
    return input(prompt).strip().title()

def get_number_input(prompt):
    """Get a number from user with error handling"""
    while True:
        try:
            return float(input(prompt))
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number!")

# Use these functions for better user experience
name = get_clean_input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(get_number_input("Enter your age: "))
height = get_number_input("Enter your height in feet: ")

print(f"Hello {name}! You are {age} years old and {height} feet tall.")
```
