# Chapter 4: Making Decisions 🤔

Time to make your programs smart! Until now, your programs always did the same thing. Now we'll learn how to make them react differently based on different situations using conditional statements. 🧠

## What are Conditional Statements? 🤷‍♀️

Conditional statements let your program make decisions, just like you do every day:

- **If** it's raining, bring an umbrella
- **If** you're hungry, eat something  
- **If** it's your birthday, celebrate!

In Python, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make these decisions.

## Your First If Statement 🎯

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
    print("You're an adult!")

print("This always prints")
```

**How it works:**
- `if age >= 18:` checks if the condition is True
- If True, the indented code runs
- If False, the indented code is skipped
- The colon `:` and indentation are super important!

## Comparison Operators 🔍

These operators let you compare values:

```python
a = 10
b = 20

print(a == b)    # False (equal to)
print(a != b)    # True (not equal to)
print(a < b)     # True (less than)
print(a > b)     # False (greater than)
print(a <= b)    # True (less than or equal to)
print(a >= b)    # False (greater than or equal to)
```

## If-Else: Two Choices 🔀

```python
temperature = int(input("What's the temperature? "))

if temperature > 75:
    print("It's hot! Wear shorts 🩳")
else:
    print("It's cool! Wear a jacket 🧥")

print("Have a great day!")
```

## If-Elif-Else: Multiple Choices 🎰

```python
score = int(input("Enter your test score: "))

if score >= 90:
    print("Amazing! You got an A! 🌟")
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    print("Great job! You got a B! 👏")
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    print("Good work! You got a C! 👍")
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    print("You passed with a D. Keep studying! 📚")
    grade = "D"
else:
    print("You got an F. Don't give up! 💪")
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your final grade is: {grade}")
```

## Boolean Logic 🧠

### Combining Conditions with `and` & `or`

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
has_license = input("Do you have a driver's license? (yes/no): ").lower()

# Both conditions must be True
if age >= 16 and has_license == "yes":
    print("You can drive! 🚗")
else:
    print("You can't drive yet. 🚫")

# At least one condition must be True
weather = input("Is it sunny or warm? (yes/no): ").lower()
if weather == "yes" or temperature > 70:
    print("Great day for a picnic! 🧺")
```

### Using `not` to Reverse Conditions

```python
is_raining = False

if not is_raining:
    print("Let's go for a walk! 🚶‍♀️")
else:
    print("Let's stay inside! 🏠")
```

## Interactive Examples 🧪

### Example 1: Simple Login System
```python
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if username == "admin" and password == "secret123":
    print("🎉 Welcome, admin!")
    print("Access granted to control panel.")
elif username == "user" and password == "pass123":
    print("👋 Hello, user!")
    print("Welcome to your dashboard.")
else:
    print("❌ Invalid credentials!")
    print("Access denied.")
```

### Example 2: Age-Based Activity Recommender
```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age < 5:
    activity = "playing with toys 🧸"
elif age < 13:
    activity = "riding bikes 🚲"
elif age < 18:
    activity = "studying and hanging with friends 📚👫"
elif age < 65:
    activity = "working and building your career 💼"
else:
    activity = "enjoying retirement and hobbies 🌻"

print(f"At {age} years old, you might enjoy {activity}!")
```

### Example 3: Smart Calculator
```python
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} × {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"{num1} ÷ {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero! 🚫")
else:
    print("Error: Invalid operation! Use +, -, *, or /")
```

## Nested If Statements 🪆

You can put if statements inside other if statements:

```python
weather = input("How's the weather? (sunny/rainy/cloudy): ").lower()

if weather == "sunny":
    temperature = int(input("What's the temperature? "))
    if temperature > 80:
        print("Perfect beach day! 🏖️")
    elif temperature > 60:
        print("Great day for outdoor activities! 🌞")
    else:
        print("Sunny but a bit chilly! 🧥")
elif weather == "rainy":
    print("Good day to stay inside and code! ☔💻")
elif weather == "cloudy":
    print("Nice day for a peaceful walk! ☁️🚶‍♀️")
else:
    print("I don't recognize that weather! 🤷‍♀️")
```

## String Comparisons 📝

```python
name = input("What's your name? ").strip().lower()

# Check if string starts with certain letters
if name.startswith('a'):
    print("Your name starts with A! 📝")

# Check if string contains certain characters
if 'x' in name:
    print("Your name has an X in it! ❌")

# Multiple string conditions
favorite_color = input("What's your favorite color? ").strip().lower()

if favorite_color in ['blue', 'navy', 'cyan']:
    print("You like blue colors! 💙")
elif favorite_color in ['red', 'pink', 'crimson']:
    print("You like red colors! ❤️")
elif favorite_color in ['green', 'lime', 'forest']:
    print("You like green colors! 💚")
else:
    print(f"{favorite_color.title()} is a beautiful color! 🌈")
```

## Practical Exercises 💻

### Exercise 1: Number Analyzer
Create a program that asks for a number and tells the user:
- If it's positive, negative, or zero
- If it's even or odd
- If it's a multiple of 5

### Exercise 2: Password Strength Checker
Create a program that checks if a password is:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains both letters and numbers
- Rate it as "Weak", "Medium", or "Strong"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ⚠️

1. **Forgetting the colon:**
```python
# Wrong:
if age > 18
    print("Adult")

# Right:
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
```

2. **Wrong indentation:**
```python
# Wrong:
if age > 18:
print("Adult")  # Should be indented!

# Right:
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")
```

3. **Using assignment instead of comparison:**
```python
# Wrong:
if age = 18:  # This assigns 18 to age!

# Right:
if age == 18:  # This compares age to 18
```

## Chapter Summary 📝

🎉 **Excellent work!** You now know how to:
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions
- Compare values with comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
- Combine conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`
- Create nested conditional statements
- Handle different types of user input
- Build interactive programs that respond intelligently

**Key takeaways:**
- Indentation matters! All code inside an `if` block must be indented
- Use `==` for comparison, not `=` (which is for assignment)
- `elif` lets you check multiple conditions in order
- Boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`) makes complex conditions possible
- Always consider edge cases and invalid input
