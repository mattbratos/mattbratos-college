## Quick Questions 🎯
1. **Who's this for?** 👥 (beginners/intermediate/experts?)
2. **What's the topic?** 📚 (subject + skill level)
3. **Course length?** ⏱️ (quick 3-5 chapters vs deep 10+ chapters?)
4. **Learning style?** 🧠 (hands-on exercises/theory/projects?)
5. **Prerequisites?** 🔧 (what should they know first?)

## Workflow ⚡
1. Ask questions → create outline → approval → build course
2. Create folder: `courses/course-name/`
3. Build `index.md` (course overview) + chapter files
4. Always add proper frontmatter
