## 🔍 Overview

### 💡 About

The E2 Treaty Investor Visa is a fast-track for startup founders from treaty countries to live and build in the US. It’s lean, renewable, and perfect if you’ve got capital and control.

### ✅ Requirements

* You’re from an E2 treaty country [list](#list-of-e2-treaty-countries)
* You invest \~\$100K+ of your own money
* You own 50%+ of a US-based company

### 🎯 Benefits

* Fast approval (\~3 months)
* High success rate (91%+)
* Spouse can work anywhere in US
* Renewable indefinitely as long as startup stays legit


### 💸 Cost

Here’s a rough estimate of what the E2 journey will run you:

| Item | Cost Estimate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Company setup | $1,500 | Delware C-Corp via [Clerky](https://www.clerky.com/) |
| Legal fees | $3,000–$8,000 | Optional but smart |
| Investment | $100,000+ | Must be your money, not investors |
| Visa fees | $205+ | Per applicant, consular fees vary |
| Admin costs | $500–$2,000 | Accounting, business address, etc |

👉 Total estimate: **$105K–$115K+**

### ⌚️ Timeline 

If you meet the requirements is shuold take around 3 months (will let you know how fast it took for me I'm starting process at 8th July 2025 but I already have company seted up) if you don't have a company set up this process will probably add 2-4 months before you will be able to apply for E-2 visa. 

PS: I wrote a guide on how to start a company in the US remotly [here](www.example.com) 


## 🛠 Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Form your US company**

   * Form C-Corp via [Clerky](https://www.clerky.com/) or [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas)
   * Open US bank account with [Mercury](https://mercury.com/) (best for internationl founders)
   * Build a business plan 

2. **Invest your own capital**

   * Spend on operations, not just savings
   * Track and document everything

3. **Prepare visa application**

   * Fill DS-160 + DS-156E
   * Gather documents: ownership, funds, business plan, invoices

4. **Attend visa interview**

   * Schedule with US consulate
   * Bring full docs + know your business cold

5. **Get approved and enter US**

   * Start running your business
   * Keep records for renewals
