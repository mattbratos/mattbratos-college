# Intro
Recently I have to explain what's my startup is about like 10 times a day so I figured that it would be much easier to just write one good esays about it. So here it is :)
TL:DR
It's an online univeristy that is going to be 100x better then Harvard by 2030 and a triliion dolar company by 2040.

# Problem
Universties become usless, because they:
1. don't prepare students for real world work anymore.
2. are extremally overpriced
3. give diplomas that nobody respects anymore (besides ocupations where you need it for legal resons like doctors or lawyers)
4. evolve extramlly slowly
5. didn't find a way to deal with ai and covid and everyone knows that students are contently cheating
6. got coruppted by wokeism
7. have terribly bad software
8. stopped innovating long time ago
9. lost connection with the job market
10. students and employers don't respect them anymore

# Solution
University 2.0 that is
- alwayes free for everyone
- has no entry bariers (for both teachers and students)
- designed for ai
- evolving crazy fast
- empower individuals not institutions
- one organism with the job market

# Strategy
In the incoming years hundrets of milions of people are going to lose their job because of the ai revolution and will need to reskill in weeks not years.
They will need to quickly find a new idea for what they want to do with their life and learn new skills for new jobs and got hire fast.
They can't afford going back to uni so they will come to the internet and right now I belive that there is no platform that accually meets their needs.
I'm 100% sure that well design education platform will outcompete Harvard in next 5 years but I can't see anyone building it. Since I had this idea I was sure that google, facebook or another gient will build it but it doesn't look like that so I guess I will try to build my own :)


# Design
I spent 100s of huors thkining about the perfect desing of an education software and here is what I came up with:
- content must be stored on github in public repos and evolve like an open source software. Students need to be able to find bugs and submit prs to improve the content
- it must be an open platform where everyone can start teaching whatever and however he wants
- it must be simple, minimalistic and beautiful. Think about it as an interactive textbook
- teaching must be done by founders. homebrew is going to be the primary place for talking to users for startup founders.
