## intro
Hi Hackers 👋

In this guide I'm gonna tell about how you can move to the US and legally live and run your startup here.

## about me
I'm a startup founder and I wanted to move to the US for like a decade now.
I did hundreds of hours of research on all possible legal paths and I finally found a way to move to San Francisco.
I also learned about majority of ways people are doing that so I decided to write this guide to save you some time.

Right now I'm still in Warsaw, Poland but in September I'm going to San Francisco for 3 months to fundraise and hopefully from the new year I'm moving there for good.
I'm not a lawyer, it's not a legal advice I will just tell you what worked for me and what I learned along the way.
So if you also want to move to San Francisco to build your startup this guide is for you.

## 🧳 ESTA — The Vybe Check Visa

ESTA (or B-1/B-2) is a super lightweight way to land in the US legally and explore.

**Best for:** First-time trip to SF, meeting investors, attending YC week, networking, conferences.

You **can’t work or earn money**, but you can do a lot of relationship-building. If you’re not sure if SF is for you—this is your move.

- ✅ No interview
- 💻 Apply online
- 🕒 90 days max
- ❌ Can’t extend
- 🤑 ~$21
- 🌍 [List of ESTA Countries](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html)
- 🔗 [Apply for ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)

**Pro tip:** Plan it like a mission. Land, crush meetings, take notes, don’t overstay.

PS: If you are from a country that is not eligible for ESTA you still can apply for [B-1/B-2](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html/visa)

## 🧠 O-1 — The "Extraordinary Founder" Visa

This is the visa you *really* want. If you’ve got some traction—like YC, Techstars, funding, press, patents, open source—this may be your golden ticket.

USCIS lets your own **Delaware C-Corp sponsor you**, so you don’t need a job offer anymore. Massive unlock for founders.

**Best for:** Mid-stage founders who’ve done some cool stuff and can prove they’re top of their field.

- ✅ Legal to work on your startup
- ✅ Path to EB-1 green card
- 🔁 Renewable
- 🧾 Need strong documentation (press, VC, awards, etc.)
- 💵 ~$5–10K in legal fees + filing
- 🕒 15 days (with premium processing)
- 📌 Must hit at least 3 of 8 criteria (USCIS has a checklist)
- 🔗 [O-1 Info & Criteria](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement)

**Pro tip:** Start building your O-1 case even if you're not applying yet. Save every press mention, funding announcement, letter of recommendation, award, patent, etc.

## 💼 E-2 — The Cheat Code for Treaty Country Founders

This is how I’m doing it.

If you're from an E-2 treaty country (like Poland, UK, Germany, Japan, etc.) and you’ve got **$100k+ of your own money** you can invest into a US startup—you can *buy your way into the US legally*.

**Best for:** Solo founders or small teams who want to bootstrap into the US ecosystem quickly.

- ✅ No “extraordinary ability” required
- ✅ Spouse gets work permit
- 🔁 Renewable indefinitely (as long as business runs)
- 💼 Need to own 50%+ of a real US business
- 💸 Must invest *your* money (not VCs)
- 🏠 Can’t be passive—you have to actively run the business
- 💵 ~$5–8K in legal + $100k+ investment
- 🕒 ~1–3 months via US consulate interview
- 🌍 [List of E-2 Treaty Countries](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/fees/treaty.html)
- 🔗 [E-2 Visa Info](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors)

**Pro tip:** You can spend part of that $100k on real things—website, laptops, legal, tools, marketing, etc. Just keep clean records and receipts.

I've done some research and wanted to share info but some of this probably is wrong, I'm not a lawyer and just sharing thoughts online.
