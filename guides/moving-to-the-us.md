## why this guide exists

I wanted to move to the US since I was a kid, but the immigration system was always super confusing. So I decided to write a short guide that will hopefully save you some time learning about possible options.

This guide is only a brief overview about types of visas you can get and which of them is the best in your situation. 

If you want a shortcut just fill this prompt and ask woz 🙃

## choose your adventure

Split it by your goal:

### 1. 💫 Vybe check (1–12 weeks)

Just wanna see if SF is your thing? These are short-term ways in:

- B1/B2 – Business or tourist visa. Good for short visits and meetings. Don’t overstay.
- ESTA – Visa waiver for certain countries (90 days max, no extensions).

### 2. ✈️ Temporary move (1–5 years)

Wanna work or build in the US but can't get a green card yet? Use one of these:

- E-2 – Invest $50k-150k in your own startup. Only works if your country has a treaty.
- L-1 – Transfer from your foreign company to its US office.
- O-1 – You’re a badass with awards, press, or major work. No investment needed.
- H-1B – Classic work visa. Needs a US sponsor and luck in the lottery.
- TN - Fast-track for Canadian and Mexican pros.

### 3. 🏡 Move for good (Green card routes)

These give you permanent residence (aka green card):

- EB-5 – Invest $800k–$1M in a US biz. Clean path, but expensive.
- EB-1A – O-1 but permanent. For top-tier founders with major credentials.
- EB-2 NIW – Prove your work benefits the US. More flexible than EB-1.
- EB-1C – Big shot execs moving from international HQ to US branch.

## next steps

Figure out what you need, then dive deep into 1–2 options.

In my situation (european solo founder, mvp build, no revenue, no big investors, no employees) I choosed E-2 because it was the easiest, fastest and the most reliable option. 

I wrote a full guide on how to get the E-2 visa [here](e2-visa-101.md)

## 🧠 hacker takeaway

US immigration is hard, but not impossible. If you’re serious, start with your goals and work backward. Most founders either:
- Start with a vybe check on ESTA or B1/B2
- Do medium-term move (O-1 or E-2)
