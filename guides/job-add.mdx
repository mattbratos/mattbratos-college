🏴‍☠️ It’s more fun to be a pirate than join the navy 🏴‍☠️
If this quote resonates you have one in a life time opportunity to join a wild startup, leave the navy and build the university that kills universities 🙃

🧠 TL;DR
We're building University 2.0 — AI-native, open, free for all, fast as hell, and 100x better than Harvard.
We’ve got the vision, founding, and a clear playbook.
Now we need a founding engineer / CTO to build it with us.

🚨 What’s broken?
Universities are dinosaurs:
Slow
Expensive
Out of touch
Useless for most real-world jobs
Clueless about AI, remote work, or how people actually learn
The world’s smartest people know this — and they’re looking for something new. We’re building that.

🔥 What we’re building
A global university that:
Is free and open — content live on GitHub
Has zero gatekeeping — anyone can teach, anyone can learn
Is built for AI — and helps people reskill fast
Looks and feels like a dev tool, not a school

🛠️ Your role
You’ll be the founding engineer with potential to become CTO:
Your main job will be to build, test and refine MVP


Own the full stack: React, Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, Stripe, ShadcnUI, Postgres, Vercel, OpenAI APIs
Ship extremely fast — we’re talking MVP in hours, not weeks
Architect the platform — GitHub-based course system, AI tutoring, college pages, etc.
Decide tech direction, infra, hiring, and code standards
Co-create the future of education with a founder who gives a damn

🚀 Who you are
You are young, smart, hardworking and irrationally ambitious
You’re a full-stack hacker who builds for fun
You can go from idea → deployed prototype in 24h
You know React and Next.js like the back of your hand
You’ve touched Vercel, OpenAI, GitHub APIs, Tailwind
You care about learning, tools, and freedom
You want to have a real positive impact on this world
You are ready to work at an early stage startup pace and sacrifice work-life balance for few months to build something great
You are good with design and care about aesthetics

🎁 What you get
Equity (5% - 30%)
Salary ($3-9k a month )
Adventure of a lifetime
A real chance to build a generational wealth
As close as you can get to YCombinator experience while being in Poland and potentially joining YC in the next batch

📍Location
For now Warsaw (we’re here), but we want to move to San Francisco this year and potentially take you with us :)

This is not a job. It's a rebellion. Let's burn the old system down and build something better.
