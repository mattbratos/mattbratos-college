 # Proper Deadlift Guide

 ## 1. Why the Deadlift Matters
 - **Full-body strength:** Hinges hips, back, grip, core, legs.
 - **Functional movement:** Mirrors real-world lifting and athletic patterns.
 - **Hormonal response:** Big muscle recruitment can boost anabolic hormones.

 ## 2. Equipment & Environment
 - **Barbell & plates:** Olympic bar (≈20 kg/45 lb) or hex/trap bar if easing lower-back stress.
 - **Platform/flat floor:** Even, non-slippery footing.
 - **Weightlifting shoes or flat-soled shoes:** Firm base; avoid cushioned running shoes.
 - **Optional accessories:** Chalk for grip, lifting straps (advanced/overload work), belt (once you know your bracing).

 ## 3. Setup & Foot Position
 1. **Foot placement:**
    - Mid-foot under the bar (bar roughly over shoelaces).
    - Feet hip-width apart (toes pointing straight or slightly outward).
 2. **Bar path:**
    - Close to shins (≈1–2 cm away).
    - Bar should travel in a roughly vertical line.

 ## 4. Grip & Hand Placement
 - **Grip width:** Hands just outside your legs (arms vertical).
 - **Grip style:**
   - Double overhand (start here; builds balanced grip).
   - Mixed grip (one palm facing you, one away) for heavy loads; be mindful of potential imbalances.

 ## 5. Bracing & Hinge Mechanics
 1. **Hips & knees:**
    - Hips sit between knee and shoulder height.
    - Knees bent enough so shins touch the bar.
 2. **Spine & chest:**
    - Neutral spine (no rounding or hyperextension).
    - Ribcage down; chest “up” (think proud chest, but not over-arched).
 3. **Shoulders & lats:**
    - Shoulders slightly in front of bar.
    - Pull lats down/back—“pinch an imaginary ball under your armpits.”
 4. **Core brace:**
    - Take a big diaphragmatic breath into your belly/obliques.
    - Brace like you’re about to be punched in the stomach.

 ## 6. The Pull (Execution)
 1. **Initial drive:**
    - Push the floor away through your heels/mid-foot.
    - Keep the bar in contact with legs.
 2. **Maintain bar path:**
    - Bar moves straight up, close to legs.
 3. **Hip and knee extension:**
    - Both extend simultaneously; hips and shoulders rise at equal pace.
 4. **Lockout:**
    - At top, stand tall with hips fully extended (“squeeze the glutes”).
    - Don’t hyperextend lumbar spine—just a vertical torso.

 ## 7. The Descent (Lowering the Bar)
 1. **Hinge first:**
    - Push hips back, maintaining neutral spine.
 2. **Knee bend:**
    - Once bar passes knees, bend knees to lower to the floor.
 3. **Controlled pace:**
    - Lower under control; resist gravity rather than dropping.

 ## 8. Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them
 | Mistake                           | How to Fix                                          |
 |-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
 | Rounding the lower back           | Brace core harder; keep chest up; practice lighter loads. |
 | Hips shooting up too fast         | Think “push knees back” and keep bar close to legs.  |
 | Bar too far from shins            | Reset so bar is over mid-foot; “shins to bar” setup. |
 | Over-arching at lockout           | Stop when hips and knees are straight—don’t hyperextend. |
 | Shoulders pulling ahead of hips   | Retract lats; pull shoulders back before lift.      |

 ## 9. Programming Tips
 - **Frequency:** 1–2 deadlift sessions/week (varies by experience/goals).
 - **Variations:**
   - Deficit deadlifts (stand on a small platform) for more range of motion.
   - Rack pulls (lift from a higher start) to overload lockout.
   - Romanian deadlifts (RDLs) for hamstring/glute focus.
 - **Volume & intensity:**
   - Strength focus: 3–5 sets × 3–6 reps at 80–90% 1RM.
   - Hypertrophy: 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps at 60–75% 1RM.

 ## 10. Warm-Up & Mobility
 - **Dynamic hip openers:** Leg swings, hip circles.
 - **Thoracic mobility:** Cat-camel, PVC dislocations.
 - **Glute activation:** Banded lateral walks, glute bridges.
 - **Progressive warm-up sets:** Bar only → empty plates → working weight.

 ### Final Thoughts
 The deadlift is a foundational strength mover but also technically demanding. Always prioritize technique over loading the bar. Start light, build solid mechanics, and progressively overload. Consistency and attention to detail are your best allies for long-term progress and injury prevention.
